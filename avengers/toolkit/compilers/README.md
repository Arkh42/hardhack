# Compilers for the _Avengers_ project


The main objective is to program the MCS-51 and derivatives using the assembly instructions.

Hence the need of a compiler which "translates" the assembly instructions into the corresponding operation code in hexadecimal (binary).

List of compilers that have been tested:

- [ASEM-51](./asem-51)
