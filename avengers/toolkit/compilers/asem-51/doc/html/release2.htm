<P><H2>Version 1.2, &nbsp; Jan 22, 1996:</H2></P>

<P><BIG><BR><STRONG><U>1. Bug Fixes</U></STRONG></BIG></P>

<P><BIG>
Since <NOBR>version 1.0</NOBR>, only two serious bugs have been found in
<NOBR>ASEM-51</NOBR>:
</BIG></P>

<P><BIG>
If DB or DW statements contained at least two subsequent expressions with
forward references, followed by at least one further expression or string,
the code lengths of these statements were calculated different on <NOBR>pass 1</NOBR>
and <NOBR>pass 2</NOBR>. Therefore, jumps to locations behind those statements might
have led to wrong addresses.
</BIG></P>

<P><BIG>
If a symbol name with more than 31 characters was referenced in an
instruction operand, the assembler marked that symbol reference with the
error message </BIG><CODE><NOBR>@@@@@ symbol not defined @@@@@</NOBR></CODE><BIG>,
although it was defined correctly above.
</BIG></P>

<P><BIG>
Apart of that, some minor deficiencies have been improved or corrected:
</BIG></P>

<P><BIG>
The arrows of the error messages in the list file are now pointing more
exactly to the position in the source line, where something is wrong.
</BIG></P>

<P><BIG>
ASEM and HEXBIN do no longer crash in exotic I/O error situations
(i.e. opening the door of a disk drive while reading from it),
and they can output more specific I/O error messages.
</BIG></P>

<P><BIG>
It is no longer possible to overwrite the input files by specifying
duplicate file names in the command line.
(This does not apply to device names!)
</BIG></P>

<P><BIG>
The previous field separator '=' for ASEM and HEXBIN command line options
had to be changed to ':', because of two reasons:<BR>
It is not possible to pass a string, containing an '=' character, to a DOS
batch file as a parameter, and it cannot be assigned to a DOS environment
variable.<BR>
However, the old field separator '=' is still accepted to maintain
compatibility with previous HEXBIN versions.
</BIG></P>

<P><BIG><BR><STRONG><U>2. New Features</U></STRONG></BIG></P>

<P><BIG>
The new assembler version comes up with numerous extensions and improvements:
</BIG></P>

<P><BIG>
The /INCLUDES command line option has been introduced to specify
directories that ASEM has to search for include files.<BR>
The /DEFINE command line option has been implemented to define symbols
from the command line, for easy assembly of different program variants.<BR>
Conditional assembly has been extended with the new IFDEF and IFNDEF
meta instructions.<BR>
Primary controls may now be preceded also by general controls.<BR>
The new $PHILIPS control allows to switch to the reduced instruction set
of the Philips 83C75x family of microcontrollers.<BR>
The pseudo instruction NAME has been introduced for compatibility purposes.<BR>
The <NOBR>ASEM-51</NOBR> list file has been beautified, and contains more information.
New fancy printing facilities have been introduced with the $XREF,
$PAGEWIDTH, $DATE, $TITLE and $NOTABS controls.<BR>
The $DEBUG, $NODEBUG, $MOD51, $PAGING, $SYMBOLS, and $NOXREF controls
have been implemented for compatibility purposes.<BR>
Now all assembler controls may be replaced by their (Intel-) abbreviations.
</BIG></P>

<P><BIG>
The error message filter program ASEM2MSG has been introduced, which
allows the integration of <NOBR>ASEM-51</NOBR> into the Borland IDE for DOS.<BR>
Files ASEM.PIF and ASEM.ICO have been added to simplify the <NOBR>ASEM-51</NOBR>
installation under <NOBR>Windows 3.1</NOBR>.
</BIG></P>

<P><BIG>
Device names that are passed to ASEM or HEXBIN as command line parameters
may but need no longer be terminated with a ':' character.
</BIG></P>

<P><BIG>
<NOBR>HEXBIN 2.2</NOBR> is running about 15% faster than <NOBR>version 2.1</NOBR>.<BR>
The length of the binary output file now matches exactly the byte count
of the code.<BR>
HEXBIN now returns ERRORLEVEL&nbsp;1 on conversion errors and ERRORLEVEL&nbsp;2
on fatal runtime errors.
</BIG></P>

<P><BIG>
With this version, new processor definition files are provided:

<P><BIG>
<NOBR>ASEM_51.DOC</NOBR> has been updated accordingly, and extended with an
alphabetical 8051 instruction table. The error messages in appendices A and B
are now sorted in lexical order, and completed with brief explanations.
</BIG></P>

<P><BIG>
The bootstrap program <NOBR>BOOT-51 V1.0</NOBR> has been added to the <NOBR>ASEM-51</NOBR> package.
It allows an 8051 target system to receive an application program in
<NOBR>Intel-Hex</NOBR> format over the serial interface, load it into the external RAM,
and finally start it (provided that the board has a suitable memory map).
Once installed, <NOBR>BOOT-51</NOBR> leads to very short turn-around cycles in testing.
For detailed information refer to the ASCII text file <NOBR>BOOT51.DOC</NOBR>
provided.
</BIG></P>

<P><BIG>
An &quot;<NOBR>ASEM-51</NOBR> Updating Guide&quot; has been added to the package.
It describes, how and where to get a new <NOBR>ASEM-51</NOBR> version!
For further information see the ASCII file <NOBR>UPDATES.DOC</NOBR> provided.
