I. The ASEM-51 Support Website
==============================

If you want to

  - get the latest ASEM-51 version,
  - send bug reports, or
  - simply ask questions,

check out the ASEM-51 support website!
Presently the official home of ASEM-51 is

    http://plit.de/asem-51/

If the URL has changed in the meantime (and things change quickly on the
Internet), use a search-engine to find out the new ASEM-51 homepage.



II. Bug Reports
===============

Although ASEM-51 is no brand-new product, it is probably not yet quite
perfect! Whenever you experience problems with it, please do not hesitate
to send a brief error report to

        w.w.heinz@web.de

or write to the author's home address:

        W.W. Heinz
        Preuschwitzer Str. 97a
        D-95445 Bayreuth
        Germany

An error report should be written in English or German, and it should
_always_ contain the following information:

  - the user's full name and e-mail address
  - the ASEM-51 version number
  - the host platform (DOS, Windows, Linux)
  - a brief error description
  - a simplified 8051 demo program that shows the bug

If the program that causes the error, cannot be simplified to a short
demo example, or in special cases, it may also be necessary to include
one or more of the following files (if applicable):

  - original 8051 assembly source file
  - all include files
  - list file
  - Intel-HEX file and/or OMF-51 module
  - binary file (in case of HEXBIN errors)
  - capture file of console output (in case of runtime errors)
  - a detailed step-by-step description of how to reproduce the bug
  - your ASEM-51 distribution archive (in case it may be corrupted)
  - other associated files or information (if any)

In a particular situation, the user must decide himself, which information
may be necessary (or helpful) to find and fix a bug.
Whenever in doubt, attach more information than may be required!

         +-----------------------------------------------------+
Note:    |  A bug that cannot be reproduced, cannot be fixed!  |
         +-----------------------------------------------------+

If you are new to the MCS-51 family or to ASEM-51, and you are not sure
whether something striking is a bug or not, please report it regardless!
If it is a bug, it will be fixed in the next release.
If it is not, you'll always get an explanation from the author!

In most cases, the author and half a dozen beta testers cannot find all
remaining bugs of a new release.
Therefore, user feedback is a big chance for "living" free software.
As time goes by, it may become more reliable than commercial products.
Please support the freeware idea, and help to improve this program!
