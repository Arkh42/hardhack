# Project _Avengers_


_Avengers_ is a project related to the MCS-51 microcontroller, as well as its current derivatives, programmed in assembler.

_Why?_, you may ask.

Because __Avengers Assemble!__

(Yeah, I'm funny, right?)

The project is organized as follow:

- a [logbook](./logbook), that helps to understand the way everything was explored and designed, with far less filters and conciseness than a classic summary anyone can find in a scientific report,
- the [toolkit](./toolkit), which includes the tools required to program an MCS-51 microcontroller.
