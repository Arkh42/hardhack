But...why?
**********



There are many websites, fora and GitHub/GitLab/any of your choice repositories dedicated to microcontrollers and electronics.
So, before starting writing about that, I have to answer a few questions that you might have.



Who am I?
=========

I am Alexandre Quenon, Electrical Engineer (2015) and PhD Student (2017-now).
I work in the field of integrated circuits, and I teach electronics (analog and digital) and microprocessors.
I have seen many bad habits among hobbyists, students and professionals, and I believe I can contribute to modify these habits and provide a better understanding.


Why this site?
==============

Pretty much answered in the 'Who am I?' question.

Among the numerous websites, fora and repositories, there are many mistakes, (really) bad habits and non-optimized solutions.
Most of the time, people don't even understand why. Generally, I do.
And if I don't, I read advices from experts in programming, electronics or embedded systems to understand and transmit the knowledge.

Another reason is that I really enjoy to have a general knowledge of the existing technical solutions.
I like to compare them, but I generally find unfair comparisons on the internet.
This is usually due to personnal preference, such as of a programming language (like the old 'C or C++' debate).
